# Playing_With_TwitterData

 Loading Tweepy and Twthon libraries:

1. Get status of my Twitter account.

2. To fetch all tweets ever by me -- write them in an excel.

3. To draw a word cloud on the csv containing all tweets after clean up for wordcloud.

* I rarely use Twitter. However, I realize I was retweeting a lot while U.S elections.
